<h1>Bowie HipSync</h1>


This is a dancing game by <a href mailto:"simon@s-j.io" >Simon Johnson</a> and Duncan Speakman.<br/>
It’s like a fun 1 min silent dance tribute to David Bowie. Suitable for 4 - 20 players. It’s a game of elimination and you will play several rounds.<br/>
It's simpler to play than the rules suggest.<br/><br/>
<strong>It’s quite possible that there will be no winners, but you could be heroes.</strong>

<p>
<h2>What you need</h2>
A phone you can get online with.<br>
A pair of headphones.
</p>
<p>
<h2>How to play.</h2>
Assemble your players in a circle. <br/>
Go to the Bowie Hip sync page. <br/>
Someone needs to count down to the game start. 3..2..1..GO! <br/>
On 'Go', everyone presses play on the little player on the page at the same time.
<br/>
The game then plays 1 of 4 Bowie tracks at random.<br/>
Everyone needs to silently dance to the track they hear. <br/>
Look around and figure out who is dancing to the same music as you.<br/>
Then move across the dance floor so you are dancing with them in a group.
<br/>
All of the tracks are 1 min long.<br/>
When the music stops hit the reveal link to show the name of the track you are dancing to.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Win / Lose</h2>
If everyone in your group is dancing to the same tune, YAY!<br/>
If not then your whole group is out!. <br/>
Keep going with new rounds until you have 2 players left. They are the winners.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
If you think someone in your group is dancing to a different tune, you will need to find a way to expel them before the round is up or you will all be out.
<br/><br/>
If there are multiple groups all dancing to the same tune, the biggest one stays in, all the others go out...
<br/><br/>
You are not allowed to sing along or mouth along to the songs.
<br/><br/>
Try to dance as expressively as you can.
<br/><br/>
After a couple of rounds you are likely develop a shorthand. If you like you can start to reduce the length of the rounds to 30 or even 15 seconds.
